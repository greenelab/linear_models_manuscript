## Conclusion

We performed a series of analyses to determine the relative performance of linear and non-linear models across multiple tasks.
Consistent with previous papers [@doi:10.1186/s12859-020-3427-8; @doi:10.1016/j.jclinepi.2019.02.004], linear and non-linear models performed roughly equivalently in a number of tasks.
That is to say that there are some tasks where linear models perform better, some tasks where non-linear models have better performance, and some tasks where both model types are equivalent.

However, When we removed all linear signal in the data, we found that residual non-linear signal remained.
This was true in simulated data as well as GTEx and Recount3 data across several tasks.
These results also held in altered problem settings, such as using a pretraining dataset before the training dataset and using sample-wise data splitting instead of study-wise splitting.
This consistent presence of non-linear signal demonstrated that the similarity in performance across model types was not due to our problem domains having solely linear signals.

Given that non-linear signal is present in our problem domains, why doesn't that signal allow non-linear models to make better predictions?
It is possible that the non-linear signal is either entirely redundant with the linear signal or unreliable enough that non-linear methods prioritize learn the linear signal when it is present.

One limitation of our study is that the results likely do not hold in an infinite data setting.
Deep learning models have been shown to solve complex problems in biology and tend to significantly outperform linear models when given enough data.
However, we do not yet live in a world in which millions of well-annotated examples are available in many areas of biology.
Our results are generated on some of the largest labeled expression datasets in existence (Recount3 and GTEx), but our tens of thousands of samples are far from the millions or billions used in deep learning research.

We are also unable to make claims about all problem domains.
There are many potential transcriptomic prediction tasks and many datasets to perform them on.
While we show that non-linear signal is not always helpful in tissue or sex prediction, and others have shown the same for various disease prediction tasks, there may be problems where non-linear signal is more important.

Ultimately, our results show that task-relevant non-linear signal in the data, which we confirm is present, does not necessarily lead non-linear models to outperform linear ones.
Additionally, our results suggest that scientists making predictions from expression data should always include simple linear models as a baseline to determine whether more complex models are warranted.
